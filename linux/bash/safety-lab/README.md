# Safety Lab (VM Only)

⚠️ WARNING: These scripts intentionally stress/break a system.
Run ONLY in a disposable VM. Snapshot before testing.

## Purpose
- Understand failure modes (disk full / runaway processes / CPU stress)
- Learn monitoring + recovery (`df`, `du`, `top`, `ps`, `kill`, etc.)
- Practice safe experimentation

## Rules
- VM only
- Snapshot first
- Document what happened + how you recovered
